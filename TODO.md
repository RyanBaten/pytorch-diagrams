# General

- Figure out how to represent different modules
  - Custom modules?
  - Multiple diagrams?
- Programmatic clean layout rearranging
- Compile to torch

# NavBar

- General tools
  - Zoom in/Zoom out
  - Enable/Disable panning (canvas drag)

# Nodes

- Pick colorscheme to maximize readability of each node type
- Add majority of torch operations to config
- Add majority of torch layers to config
- Don't allow nodes to stack ontop of eachother
- Add ports/sections to nodes via button on node

# Links

- Bug: Link arrow from start icon node not right angled after loading from file

- Links shouldn't be created that connect to nothing
- Link routing to avoid visual bugs where the link doesn't properly touch the port
