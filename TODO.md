# General

- Figure out how to represent different modules
  - Custom modules?
- Page is too tall to fit in one screen, downsize
- Export graph

# Diagram

- Delegate zoom out to NavBar
  - Current diagram can zoom out when hovering over a node

# NavBar

- General tools
  - Zoom in/Zoom out
  - Zoom to fit?
  - Enable/Disable panning (canvas drag)
  - Export Button

# SideBar

- Cleaner sidebar, accordions for button types
- Read node definitions from config file
- Drag/Drop new node types

# Nodes

- Underlying graph representation
- Value nodes
- Add ports/sections to nodes via button on node
- Common operations as custom nodes
- Input/output nodes
- Allow only one connection between each input and output
- Background color in Node Definitions

# Links

- Link arrows
- Links shouldn't be created that connect to nothing
- Don't allow random points, make deletion easier
- Link routing to avoid visual bugs where the link doesn't properly touch the port
